					<h2 className="mb-4 text-2xl font-bold text-amber-900">Our Tax Advocacy</h2>
					<p className="mb-4 text-gray-700">
						We support efforts to eliminate sales tax on precious metals and numismatic investments in the
						remaining states that still impose these taxes. High tax burdens (often 12% or more) can
						significantly impact the viability of physical coin collecting and investing, particularly when
						they exceed typical short-term market gains.
					</p>

					<div className="mb-8 rounded-lg border border-yellow-200 bg-yellow-50 p-6">
						<h3 className="mb-2 text-lg font-semibold text-yellow-800">Impact on the Industry:</h3>
						<p className="text-gray-700">
							Heavy taxation on these investment-grade products often leads to fewer physical coin dealers in
							affected states, reducing access and market competition.
						</p>
					</div>

					<h2 className="mb-4 text-2xl font-bold text-amber-900">What You Can Do</h2>
					<div className="mb-8 rounded-lg border border-purple-200 bg-purple-50 p-6">
						<p className="text-gray-700">
							If your state currently taxes precious metals or numismatic products, we encourage you to
							contact your state representatives to advocate for tax code review and potential exemptions for
							these investment categories.
